# COVID-19-DATA-ANALYSIS

# Project overview
This project presents a dashboard summarizing global COVID-19 statistics using confirmed case data across countries and regions. The main objective is to analyze the spread, severity, and recovery trends of COVID-19 and identify key insights for data-driven decision-making.

# Data Cleaning and Preparation
Handling Missing Data: Null or incomplete entries (especially in new cases/recoveries) were cleaned or imputed.

Derived Metrics: Calculated metrics such as recovery rate and fatality rate were computed using available confirmed, death, and recovery figures.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Total Confirmed Cases: 16 million globally.

Total Deaths: 639K, implying a fatality rate of 3.93%.

Total Recoveries: 9 million, leading to a recovery rate of 58.24%.

New Metrics: 227K new cases, 5K new deaths, and 16M new recoveries in the last reporting period.

High Impact Countries: The US, Brazil, and India are the top three countries with the highest confirmed cases.

Least Affected Countries: Fiji, Saint Lucia, and Timor-Leste have the lowest case counts.

# Results and Findings
US leads globally with over 5 million confirmed cases.

South Africa dominates Africa with 78.94% of total confirmed cases among top 5 African nations.

Regional Impact: Europe has the highest number of reporting countries (54), followed by Africa (47).

Most countries with least cases are small island nations or isolated regions.

Recovery and fatality rates provide a mixed view, showing relatively good recovery but notable fatality proportions.

# Recommendations
1. Enhanced Data Reporting in Africa: Some regions show sparse data; increasing testing and data coverage is essential.
2. Focused Support to Heavily Affected Nations: Allocate resources to countries like the US, Brazil, and India to manage ongoing cases and prevent surges.
3. Despite high recovery rates, the ongoing case rise suggests a need for continued safety protocols.
